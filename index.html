      <p><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</strong></p>
      <p>
        By 2030, global development efforts are guided by the Sustainable Development Goals, which promote improved well-being through a balanced approach to economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. These goals, adopted universally and implemented voluntarily by all nations, function as a cohesive agenda built on the principle that no individual or community should be left behind.
        There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals, each addressing a specific dimension of global development. While each goal has its own focus, they are designed to work together, which means that progress in one area reinforces advancements across the others.

      <p><strong>SDG 4 – Quality Education</strong></p>
      <p>
        SDG 4 is titled Quality Education and focuses on “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. This goal emphasizes the importance of accessibility, equity, and the development of skills that empower individuals throughout their lives.
        Each Sustainable Development Goal is supported by specific targets that mention the key areas a goal aims to address and provides guidance on how progress should be achieved and evaluated. <br><br>

        <strong>Target 4.7 </strong> <br> <br> 
        One of the targets in SDG 4 is Target 4.7, which focuses on the role of education in advancing sustainability. This target states:<i> “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development.”</i> Thus, Target 4.7 highlights the need to equip learners with the competencies, values, and perspectives required to contribute responsibly to a more peaceful and sustainable world. <br> <br>

        <strong> Education for sustainable development </strong> <br> <br>
        In this context, education serves as the foundation of sustainable development because it equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to understand global challenges and make responsible decisions by fostering critical thinking, promoting social awareness, and empowering people to take meaningful action. <br><br>
        Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is a holistic approach that develops learners’ cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral skills, providing the cross-cutting competencies needed to understand and act on all Sustainable Development Goals. This concept is part of the indicator I of the Target 4.7 that positions education as a way in which everyone can be part of the solution.

      <li><strong>The problem </strong></li><br>
        The project addresses the limited knowledge and awareness of Sustainable Development Goals and the insufficient integration of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) among university students. Although SDG 4.7 highlights the need to develop competencies that enable learners to contribute to sustainability, current literature shows that higher education institutions in Latin America still incorporate few sustainability strategies, and students often lack knowledge about the SDGs. This gap becomes particularly relevant at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where no public evidence exists regarding students’ understanding of these topics, demonstrating the need to assess their level of awareness and explore ways to strengthen ESD within the academic community. <br><br>
      <li><strong> Purpose of the project </strong><br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Evaluate the level of knowledge and perceptions that undergraduate students have about the SDGs, particularly SDG 4.7 and ESD.</li>
          <li>Propose educational actions—such as activities, learning resources, and awareness tools—that foster sustainability competencies like critical thinking, collaboration, and reflection.</li>
          <li>Support the integration of ESD within the Universidad Nacional de Colombia by responding to the institutional need for evidence on students’ understanding of the SDGs.</li>
          <li>Promote informed and responsible action, encouraging students to participate actively in sustainability efforts rather than assuming these responsibilities belong only to policymakers or teachers.</li>
          <li>Contribute to the SDG 4, particularly Target 4.7, by empowering students to engage with sustainability challenges and apply competencies in their academic and social contexts.</li>

    <!-- WHAT / WHY -->
    <section id="whatwhy" class="card">
      <h2>What & Why</h2>
      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>
        We will run talks and build an online resource center to promote respectful, inclusive and supportive spaces
        for the UNAL community. People will be able to share experiences (rude teachers, staff, classmates) and learn practical tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
        Discrimination, inequality and environmental problems are reinforced by misinformation and lack of education.
        If the university does not teach these topics, peace, respect for diversity and care for nature are harder to achieve.
        University is where we interact most — therefore it is the ideal place to change social dynamics through education.

    <!-- WHO -->
    <section id="who" class="card">
      <h2>Who?</h2>
      <p>We will work mainly with students and educators at Universidad Nacional. They are key agents and are accessible for surveys and interviews.</p>

    <!-- HOW / WHERE -->
    <section id="howwhere" class="card">
      <h2>How & Where</h2>
      <p>
        We will do exhaustive research (articles, studies), then design surveys and interviews to adapt solutions to the university context.
        Implementation will happen on campus — during Bienestar activities, lunch times and other relaxed moments in shared spaces.
