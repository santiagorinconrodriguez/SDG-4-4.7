    <p><strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</strong></p>

    <p>
      By 2030, global development efforts are guided by the Sustainable Development Goals,
      which promote improved well-being through a balanced approach to economic growth,
      social inclusion, and environmental protection. These goals, adopted universally and
      implemented voluntarily by all nations, function as a cohesive agenda built on the
      principle that no individual or community should be left behind. There are 17 Sustainable
      Development Goals, each addressing a specific dimension of global development. While
      each goal has its own focus, they are designed to work together, which means that
      progress in one area reinforces advancements across the others.

    <p><strong>SDG 4 – Quality Education</strong></p>

    <p>
      SDG 4 is titled Quality Education and focuses on “Ensure inclusive and equitable
      quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. This goal
      emphasizes the importance of accessibility, equity, and the development of skills
      that empower individuals throughout their lives. Each Sustainable Development Goal
      is supported by specific targets that mention the key areas a goal aims to address
      and provides guidance on how progress should be achieved and evaluated.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Target 4.7</strong><br><br>
      One of the targets in SDG 4 is Target 4.7, which focuses on the role of education in
      advancing sustainability. This target states:
      <i>“By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to
      promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for
      sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality,
      promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation
      of cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development.”</i>
      Thus, Target 4.7 highlights the need to equip learners with the competencies, values,
      and perspectives required to contribute responsibly to a more peaceful and sustainable
      world.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Education for sustainable development</strong><br><br>
      In this context, education serves as the foundation of sustainable development because
      it equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to understand global
      challenges and make responsible decisions by fostering critical thinking, promoting
      social awareness, and empowering people to take meaningful action.
      <br><br>
      Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is a holistic approach that develops learners’
      cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioral skills, providing the cross-cutting competencies
      needed to understand and act on all Sustainable Development Goals. This concept is part of
      the indicator I of the Target 4.7 that positions education as a way in which everyone can be
      part of the solution.

      <li><strong>The problem</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    The project addresses the limited knowledge and awareness of Sustainable Development Goals and
    the insufficient integration of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) among university
    students. Although SDG 4.7 highlights the need to develop competencies that enable learners to
    contribute to sustainability, current literature shows that higher education institutions in
    Latin America still incorporate few sustainability strategies, and students often lack knowledge
    about the SDGs. This gap becomes particularly relevant at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia,
    where no public evidence exists regarding students’ understanding of these topics, demonstrating
    the need to assess their level of awareness and explore ways to strengthen ESD within the academic
    community.

        <li class="level-2">1.  <strong> Research Questions </strong>
          
          <p>What is the level of knowledge and the perceptions of the Sustainable Development Goals among undergraduate students in Human Sciences and Engineering at the Bogotá campus of the National University of Colombia?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <ol start="7.2">
        <li class="level-2">2. <strong>Methodology </strong>
          <p>This study employed a descriptive, quantitative approach to examine the knowledge of the students and their perceptions of the Sustainable Development Goals by using a survey, as structured questionnaires are effective tools for measuring awareness and attitudes across large student populations and its easy implementation and low cost. The resulting data allows a comparative analysis between both faculties providing a detailed description of knowledge levels, perception patterns, and existing gaps.</p>

          <ol start="7.2.1">
            <li class="level-3">2.1  <strong>Survey </strong> 
              <p>The survey was designed to assess students’ knowledge, perceptions, and willingness to act regarding the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. It evaluates cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional dimensions aligned with UNESCO’s learning indicators for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD).</p>

              <p><strong>Design of the survey:</strong> The survey is organized into five sections, each with a specific objective:</p>
              <ol type="a">
                <li><strong>Demographic Section:</strong> collects basic participant information—age, gender, faculty, year of study, and previous exposure to sustainability topics.
                  <p>Purpose: To analyze how demographic factors relate to SDG knowledge and attitudes.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>General Knowledge of the SDGs:</strong> 3 true/false questions that assess general and introductory knowledge about SDGs.
                  <p>Purpose: To evaluate participants’ overall awareness of the SDGs without focusing on specific goals.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Specific Knowledge of Each SDG:</strong> 4 true/false questions of specific conceptual knowledge about four different SDGs selected randomly.
                  <p>Purpose: To measure conceptual and goal-specific knowledge across different SDGs.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Self-Perception by Dimension (Question Bank Section):</strong> 51 items (3 per SDG), covering cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional dimensions.
                  <p>Each question uses a 5-point Likert scale. To reduce response fatigue, 17 questions were selected by stratified sampling, one per SDG from the three dimensions.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>General Perception of the SDGs:</strong> 3 Likert-scale items about perceived importance of the SDGs.
                  <p>Purpose: To complement objective knowledge data with participant perceptions, allowing analysis of the relationship between awareness and motivation to act.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Open Questions:</strong> Two optional questions for personal reflections towards SDGs teaching and implementation in UNAL.</li>

      <ol start="7.3">
        <li class="level-2">3.   <strong>Participants</strong>
          <p>The survey was conducted with undergraduate students from the Human Sciences and Engineering faculties at the Bogotá campus of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. These academic units were selected due to their disciplinary relevance, the absence of previous studies on SDG knowledge, and the fact that their diverse perspectives and competencies can influence how students perceive the Sustainable Development Goals, making the comparisons between the two faculties interesting and relevant.</p>

          <p>This project is developed at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, an institution that has established mechanisms to align with the 2030 Agenda and sustainability criteria. However, despite these efforts, no public evidence exists regarding students’ level of knowledge about the SDGs, highlighting the need for research in this context. The university is especially relevant for advancing Education for Sustainable Development, as students—alongside policymakers and educators—also hold responsibility in promoting sustainable practices. Thus, by engaging the students and providing solutions through ESD, the project supports sustainability goals implementation.</p>
