<h2>Students’ Reflective Answers from the Survey</h2>
<section id="solution10" class="card">
  <ol>
    <li>
    <p>This activity consists of students answering a few questions in a survey, regarding their reflections on sustainability and the SDGs promoting awareness and critical thinking on how students can act. </p>
    <p> Would you like to know their answers?</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

<section id="solution9" class="card">
    <p><strong>What competences do you think that should be strengthened in our college to create able students to promote sustainability and peace?</strong></p>
    <p>“I feel that it would be ideal to strengthen a multidisciplinary learning that’s not only limited or aimed for each one's degree, it is important to understand the problems from multiple disciplines, addressing different knowledge areas and at the same time promoting critical thinking in an understanding way, in addition to implementing collaborative spaces to acquire the skill to work together and find solutions.”<br><br>

“I consider that to strengthen the sense of belonging that we have in our university environment, it is a good starting point, and something that I mention because, at least, in my case, the available spaces like “Introduction to Civil Engineering” didn’t have the impact that I thought it would have. Most of the time we talked about international projects and the first world, but to create a change, we have to look first to our own situation/overview.”<br><br>

“Universities have to strengthen the socio-emotional competences (empathy, dialogue and conflict solving), critical and systemic thinking, ethics and social responsibility, the knowledge in sustainability ( Environmental management and circular economy) , Intercultural competences, innovation with a sustainable focus and participant leadership.”<br><br>

“In my opinion, the alliance between the members of our university community should be strengthened in order to accomplish the objectives. UNAL grows in us the desire to achieve our objectives that DS proposes, however, achieving them, requires that the community comes along and starts working together, sadly this unit isn’t present.” <br><br>
</p>

<section id="solution10" class="card">
<p><strong>In your opinion. How can UNAL better introduce sustainability and human rights values in your academic formation?</strong></p>
<p>“It could be introduced with better academic level coverage. With optional subjects or “cátedras” that everyone could choose depending on their likes and preferences.”<br><br>

“It is a complex topic, mainly because lots of behaviours and attitudes that come from a cultural influence that could vary depending on social, academic and familiar contexts. I do believe that that is the best way to create an effective connection between sustainability and other values, whether they are human rights or ethics. It could start by activities that lend themselves to the connection, relation and knowledge exchanges. Activities that manage to get the attention of the most part of the public or even activities that are aimed at certain types of groups that lead us to recognize the significant factors to make a decisive change. There are certain people that don’t like to be imposed on specific ideas or practices that could also be imparted in the classrooms. I feel that the only way to implement these aspects is to reaffirm the sense of belonging.”<br><br>


“UNAL has really good sustainability ideas like the internal public transport by means of the bicycles, I believe that to find more of them, festivals and exhibitions where students get to propose different and fresh ideas could be created. Taking this into account, they would be encouraging students and at the same time including student needs.”<br><br>


“To turn sustainability and human rights into key aspects of all of its projects, to stimulate startups and relations with the communities, to strengthen the investigations about the environment and peace, to prepare professors into these focuses and to transform the campus into an example of inclusive and sustainable management. This would make it possible to prepare professionals that are truly committed to social justice, the care of our territory and coexistence.<br><br>


“I think that it could be by means of training, many people don't go, but starting the change on our own is an amazing step. On the other hand, it has to get involved in the skills of each degree. To aim for the future to young and empathetic people, kind and solidary with the environment, it seems like an amazing and accurate goal.<br><br>


“With the implementation of philosophy, ethics and moral optional courses where relevant and true debates are included.”<br><br>


“Giving incentives and prizes no matter what they are for the people that get to be real and visible, it is the only way because the other methods are not only not enough but also not efficient.” <br><br>
