<h2>Real Stories that Demonstrate Why the SDGs Matter</h2>
<section id="solution5" class="card">
<ol start = "5">
<li><i>Oxfam encourages exploring “the local in the global,” which reinforces the value of connecting real human experiences with abstract global goals.</i><br><br>
<p>This activity consists of presenting real testimonies and short case studies that illustrate the consequences of lacking access to education, health, equality, or other SDGs. These stories help students understand how global challenges affect individuals and communities and motivates learners to see the goals as relevant.</p>
<b>Cases:</b><br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Samia, an eleven-year-old girl in Somaliland, was forced to leave school in 2009 when her family could no longer afford fees. Because boys’ education is traditionally prioritized, her five brothers continued studying while she stayed home to do household work and care for her sick father. Although she was a capable and motivated student, gender discrimination and financial hardship denied her access to education. Her story shows how poverty and cultural norms prevent girls from receiving equal, quality education, directly highlighting the challenges SDG 4 seeks to address.

  <li>Margarita, a girl from rural Ecuador, has been unable to attend school for a year and a half due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Living in a remote community, she spends her days doing household chores and helping her father with farm work instead of studying. Before the pandemic, she walked long distances down difficult terrain to reach her school, but the prolonged closure left her without access to learning and without contact with her classmates. Her story highlights how rural children face major barriers to quality education, especially during crises, illustrating the inequalities SDG 4 aims to overcome.</li>
